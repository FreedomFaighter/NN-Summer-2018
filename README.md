# NN-Summer-2018

Richardson's Neural Networks Class

Purpose: Store and play with code.

The Midterm Construction:
1. Preprocessing code (reading-in, cross-validation i.e. the 70-30 split, and normalization of the data). Complete.
2. Apply 4 NN models from CH3 using SKLearn (Perceptron, Logistic, SVM, Decision Tree). Complete
    *Also note that we are supplied with a plotting decision region routine.
3. Make a pipeline that does all four, and graphs the comparative differences between all of them. (Accuracy, time, etc.)
