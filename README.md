# NN-Summer-2018

Richardson's Neural Networks Class

Final Project: Make a Friend. Reddit-Chatbot.

## The Final Roadmap:
1. Find Dataset (complete)
2. Code that buffers data into highly rated comment-reply. Perhaps thread-reply from askreddit, changemyview, or something.
3. Study RNN for Neural-Translation Machines (provided by google).


## The Midterm Construction:
1. Preprocessing code (reading-in, cross-validation i.e. the 70-30 split, and normalization of the data). Complete.
2. Apply 4 NN models from CH3 using SKLearn (Perceptron, Logistic, SVM, Decision Tree). Complete
    *Also note that we are supplied with a plotting decision region routine.
3. Make a pipeline that does all four, and graphs the comparative differences between all of them. (Accuracy, time, etc.)
